test
====

This is a test repository for trying git/github features. Should be used 
by team members who are not very familiar with Git/GitHub, and want to 
try things out just to see how they work. Purpose is not to have mess in 
the main/working repositories. Thus this test repository is supposed to 
be a mess. ;)
